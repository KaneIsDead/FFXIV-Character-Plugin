# FFXIV-Character-Plugin

This is project to write a wordpress plugin which allows people to have data from their FFXIV characters
in their very own Database. With this another target is to enable the user to place information of his
character on his WP site wherever he wishes. 

I plan on using the XIVPads Lodestone API (https://github.com/viion/XIVPads-LodestoneAPI)
for communication.
